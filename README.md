This repo is similar to oddgenes in motivation, but I wanted to cover weird biology in general for things, even some genome related things, that didn't entirely fit into oddgenes. Feel free to make PRs for more stuff!


# Genomes

## Large numbers of chromosomes in a butterfly

"Today I learned that the Atlas blue butterfly has 448â€“452 chromosomes. The highest number among  non-polyploid eukaryotic organisms."

## Large number of sex chromosomes in platypus

"Our previous studies showed that male platypus has five X and five Y chromosomes, no SRY, and DMRT1 on an X chromosome"

More complete genome sequencing was done 2001 https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8081666/


## Seven different "genomes" in a single celled organism

Like we have mitochondrial genome in our cells, this single celled organism has 7 different genomes in it's cell

# Cellular

## Multiple-fission cell division

Dental plaque bacteria elongates and then splits into 3-14 cells in a cell division https://www.sciencealert.com/bacteria-in-your-mouth-reproduce-in-a-strange-rare-way-scientists-discover

# Sex

## Parthogenesis

Parthenogenesis is an embryo that grows directly from unfertilized eggs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis)

Some species (e.g. whiptail lizards) are entirely female (https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/animals/are-there-any-all-female-species-in-the-wild.html)

There are other types of asexual reproduction as well https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexual_reproduction

## Species with "more than two sexes"?

https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/77371/are-there-lifeforms-that-have-more-than-2-sexes

See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_system#List_of_sexual_systems

## Male pregnancy

Seahorses are a common example where they will host the growing embryos

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_pregnancy

## Sexual cannibalism

There are a variety of 'reasons' why cannibalism and sexual cannibalism occurs, but it is common across the tree of life https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_cannibalism

There are other types of cannibalism also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism

## Traumatic insemination

A number of examples listed here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_conflict
