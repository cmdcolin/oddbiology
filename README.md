This repo is similar to oddgenes in motivation, but I wanted to cover weird biology in general for things, even some genome related things, that didn't entirely fit into oddgenes. Feel free to make PRs for more stuff!


# Genomes

## Large numbers of chromosomes in a butterfly

"Today I learned that the Atlas blue butterfly has 448â€“452 chromosomes. The highest number among  non-polyploid eukaryotic organisms."

## Seven different "genomes" in a single celled organism

Like we have mitochondrial genome in our cells, this single celled organism has 7 different genomes in it's cell

# Sex

## Parthogenesis

Parthenogenesis is an embryo that grows directly from unfertilized eggs. Some species (e.g. whiptail lizards) are entirely female. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis

There are other types of asexual reproduction as well https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexual_reproduction

## Species with "more than two sexes"?
